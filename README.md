Example:
You always type /pick for server interaction in chat, it gets repetative. 

Run script, type /pick in textbox, set hotkey that you want to use to send command on demand.

Enter chat, press hotkey when needed. 

Update V2.8

  Black theme. Added progress bar. Added timeleft for current job. Fixed window size. 

Update V2.5

  Added repeat send message functionality and message count input. 
  
Update V2.0

  enter a number to send in chat on hotkey, check the box. hotkey now sends number, next hotkey press will add 2 and send that number. Good for counting game.

Easily edit/add variables if you know minimal code, perhaps I will implement into gui eventually upon request or personal need.
